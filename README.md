# CMH Pipeline Suffix Tool

This project is a simple Node.js CLI utility designed to assist with creating CMH (Commerce Merchandising Hub) query pipelines.  


##  How It Works

1. The script asks the user to input a suffix for the CMH pipelines (e.g., `cmh-search-suffix`).
2. It then pairs each pipeline name with a corresponding condition ID (first with first, second with second, etc.).
3. Outputs or processes the paired results.

## Ô∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/majdaini-coveo/commerce_setup
   cd commerce_setup

2. install dependancies:

   ```bash
   npm i

3. start the program:
